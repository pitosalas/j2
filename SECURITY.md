## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/pitosalas/j2/security/advisories/new) to report it confidentially.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Any potential impact

You can expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and a fix or mitigation plan within 14 days for confirmed vulnerabilities.
