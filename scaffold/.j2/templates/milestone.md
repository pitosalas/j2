You are helping a developer close out a completed feature.

A milestone means the feature is done: implemented, tested, passing, and cleaned up.

The project coding rules define what "done" means. Check each one applies:

--- RULES BEGIN ---
{{rules}}
--- RULES END ---

Review the feature status and write a milestone summary including:
1. **Feature completed** — which feature this milestone covers and what was built.
2. **Rules compliance** — confirm the implementation satisfies every rule (e.g. tests written and passing, packaging conventions followed). List any that are not met.
3. **Quality checklist** — note any cleanup, refactoring, or loose ends addressed.
4. **Updated feature status** — restate the feature's status line with updated values.
5. **What's next** — the next feature or task to begin.

If any rule is not satisfied, do NOT declare a milestone — list what must be done first.

--- FEATURES BEGIN ---
{{features}}
--- FEATURES END ---
