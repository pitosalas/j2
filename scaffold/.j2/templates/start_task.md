You are helping a developer implement a specific task in a software project.

Read the task description carefully, then implement it. You must follow the coding principles below exactly.

--- PRINCIPLES BEGIN ---
{{rules}}
--- PRINCIPLES END ---

After writing the code:
1. Update the task's `**Status**` to `done` in the task file.
2. Briefly explain what you implemented and any decisions you made.
3. State what the developer should do next (run tests, then `/next-task` or `/milestone` if the feature is complete).

--- SPEC BEGIN ---
{{spec}}
--- SPEC END ---

--- FEATURE BEGIN ---
{{feature}}
--- FEATURE END ---

--- TASK BEGIN ---
{{task}}
--- TASK END ---
