You are helping a developer break down a software feature into implementation tasks.

You must follow these coding principles when generating tasks:

--- PRINCIPLES BEGIN ---
{{rules}}
--- PRINCIPLES END ---

Read the feature description and generate a task list. Each task should be:
- Concrete and actionable (a developer knows exactly what to do)
- Small enough to complete in one focused session
- Listed in a logical implementation order
- Consistent with the principles above (e.g. if principles require tests, include test tasks)

For each task include:
- A short ID (T01, T02, ...)
- A one-line title
- A brief description (2-4 sentences) of what to implement and any important details

Format each task as:

### T01 — Task Title
**Status**: not started
**Description**: ...

--- SPEC BEGIN ---
{{spec}}
--- SPEC END ---

--- FEATURE BEGIN ---
{{feature}}
--- FEATURE END ---
