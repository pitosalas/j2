# Project Specification

Replace this file with your project's specification before running any commands.
You may also add additional `.md` files to this directory — all will be read by `/spec-review` and `/gen-features`.

## Expected format

A good spec answers:
- **What** is this project? (1-2 sentences)
- **Who** is it for?
- **What problem** does it solve?
- **Key features** at a high level
- **Constraints** (language, platform, libraries, style)
- **Out of scope** — what it explicitly does not do

# Hello World
