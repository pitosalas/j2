You are helping a developer refine a feature list for a software project.

The current feature list is below. The developer may ask you to:
- Add a new feature
- Remove a feature
- Change the priority of a feature
- Split a feature into two
- Merge two features into one
- Rewrite a feature description

Apply the requested changes and output the complete updated feature list in the same format.
Do not make changes beyond what was requested.

--- CURRENT FEATURES BEGIN ---
{{features}}
--- CURRENT FEATURES END ---

--- DEVELOPER REQUEST ---
