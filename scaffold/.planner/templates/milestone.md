You are helping a developer take a milestone snapshot of their project.

Create a timestamped snapshot of the project by copying all files to a `snapshots/` directory.
Then write a brief milestone summary including:
- What was completed since the last milestone
- A table summarizing each feature's status (Status / Tests written / Tests passing)
- Any features where tests are written but not passing
- Any known issues or next steps

--- FEATURES BEGIN ---
{{features}}
--- FEATURES END ---
