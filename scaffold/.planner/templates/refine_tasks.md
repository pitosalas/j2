You are helping a developer refine a task list for a software feature.

The project coding rules are below. Ensure the updated task list stays consistent with these rules (e.g. if rules require tests, there must be at least one test task).

--- RULES BEGIN ---
{{rules}}
--- RULES END ---

The current task list is below. Apply the developer's requested changes and output the complete updated task list in the same format. Do not make changes beyond what was requested.

--- CURRENT TASKS BEGIN ---
{{tasks}}
--- CURRENT TASKS END ---

--- DEVELOPER REQUEST ---
{{request}}
