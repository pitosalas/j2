You are helping a developer save their current working context so they can resume later.

Write a concise `current.md` file capturing the state of the session. Include:

1. **What was just completed** — brief description of what was done since the last checkpoint or milestone.
2. **What is currently in progress** — the feature or task being actively worked on, and where things stand.
3. **What is next** — the immediate next steps when resuming.
4. **Open questions** — anything unresolved that needs a decision.
5. **Feature status summary** — a compact table of each feature's current status.

Keep it short enough to scan in under a minute. This is a working note, not documentation.
Output the content of `current.md` only — no explanation.

--- FEATURES BEGIN ---
{{features}}
--- FEATURES END ---
