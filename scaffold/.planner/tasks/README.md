# Tasks

This directory holds one file per feature, generated by `/gen-tasks`.
Files are named by feature ID (e.g. `F01.md`, `F02.md`).

## Expected format

Each task file follows this structure:

```
# Tasks for F01 — Feature Name

### T01 — Task Title
**Description**: What to implement, 2-4 sentences with enough detail
that a developer knows exactly what to do.

### T02 — Write tests for F01
**Description**: Write tests covering the implementation in T01.
```
