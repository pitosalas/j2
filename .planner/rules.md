# Coding Principles

These principles apply to all code written in this project.

## LLM
- To save tokens dont be verbose. Dont waste words. Dont use noise words. Dont flatter.

## Testing
- Each feature must have at least one test.

## Python
- Use version 3.10 or later
- Use type annotations sparingly
- Dont use relative imports
- Keep all imports at the top of the file
- Give variables, modules, functions intention revealing names

## Exception and error handling
- No need to test every exception
- It's ok for unusual situations to have the program just crash

## Documentation
- all functions and methods should have no more than 1-2 lines of comment at the top
- Better have a good name for a function so it doesnt require any block comment

## Packaging
- use uv for all packaging, virtual environments etc. 
- Very important: YOU SHALL NOT USE PYENV just UV!
- all code goes into a subfolder with the same name as the overall package name
