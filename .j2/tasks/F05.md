# F05 — `/gen-features` Command

## Tasks

### T01 — Add status values header to gen_features template
**Status**: done
**Description**: The generated `features.md` needs a status values legend at the top (explaining `not started / in progress / done`, `no / yes`, `n/a / no / yes`) so users know the format. Add this header guidance to `scaffold/.j2/templates/gen_features.md` so Claude always outputs it.

### T02 — Write end-to-end rendering test for gen-features
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a test that calls `runner.main()` (or the runner functions directly) with the `gen-features` command against a temp project directory containing a minimal spec, settings, and workflow. Assert the rendered output contains the spec content and the rules content — confirming both `{{spec}}` and `{{rules}}` are correctly injected.

### T03 — Verify scaffold vs installed command path difference is intentional and documented
**Status**: done
**Description**: `scaffold/.claude/commands/gen-features.md` uses `.j2/runner.py` (correct for a copied project), while `.claude/commands/gen-features.md` uses `scaffold/.j2/runner.py` (correct for this dev repo). Add a comment to `install.sh` noting this path rewrite so future maintainers don't "fix" it by mistake.
