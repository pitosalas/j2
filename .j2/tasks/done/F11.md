# F11 — Install Script Tasks

### T01 — Fix stale `/spec-review` reference
**Status**: done
**Description**: The install.sh next-steps message tells the user to run `/spec-review`, but that command was renamed to `/refresh`. Update the message to say `/refresh` instead. Single-line change at the end of install.sh.

### T02 — Write functional tests for install.sh
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests to `tests/test_commands.py` (or a new `tests/test_install.py`) that run install.sh against a temp directory and verify: (1) required `.j2/` subdirectories are created, (2) scaffold files are present in the target, (3) re-running does not overwrite an existing file (--ignore-existing). Use Python's `subprocess` and `tempfile` modules.
