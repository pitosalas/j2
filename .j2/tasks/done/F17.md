# Tasks for F17 — `/try` Command

### T01 — Make timestamp substitution explicit in try template
**Status**: done
**Description**: The rsync command in `scaffold/.j2/templates/try.md` uses the literal string `TIMESTAMP` and relies on Claude to substitute the current datetime. Make this unambiguous by replacing the placeholder with an explicit bash expression (`$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M)`) so the command can be run verbatim, and remove the separate prose instruction about the timestamp.

### T02 — Write tests for the try command
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/` verifying: (1) runner renders the try template and injects `{{features}}`, (2) the rendered output contains the rsync command. At least one test must pass per the coding principles.
