# F31 — Parallel-Safe Command Documentation

## Tasks

### T01 — Add parallel-safety section to README
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a "Parallel Usage" section to `README.md` (after the Principles section) documenting which commands are safe to run in parallel Claude Code sessions (per-feature commands: `/task-start <FID>`, `/task-next` for different features, `/tasks-gen <FID>`, `/tasks-update <FID>`) and which require exclusive access (`/features-update`, `/milestone`, `/checkpoint`, `/features-gen`). Keep it brief — a short paragraph and a two-column table.

### T02 — Add test verifying README contains parallel-safety section
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a test that reads `README.md` and asserts it contains the string "Parallel" (section heading) and mentions both safe and exclusive commands. Place in `tests/test_runner_commands.py` or a suitable existing test file.
