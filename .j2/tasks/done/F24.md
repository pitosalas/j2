# Tasks for F24 — Completed Tasks Archive

### T01 — Add `tasks/done/` directory to scaffold
**Status**: done
**Description**: Create `scaffold/.j2/tasks/done/` and add a `.gitkeep` so git tracks the empty directory. This ensures `rsync` in `install.sh` copies the directory to new projects automatically.

### T02 — Update `missing_tasks_summary` to check `tasks/done/`
**Status**: done
**Description**: In `.j2/runner.py`, update `missing_tasks_summary` to check both `tasks_dir / f"{fid}.md"` and `tasks_dir / "done" / f"{fid}.md"` before flagging a feature as missing a task file. A feature whose task file has been archived must not appear in the missing list.

### T03 — Update milestone template to move task file on success
**Status**: done
**Description**: Edit `scaffold/.j2/templates/milestone.md` to instruct Claude that after all milestone checks pass, it must run `mv .j2/tasks/<feature-id>.md .j2/tasks/done/<feature-id>.md` to archive the completed task file. The instruction should be in the "on success" section of the template.

### T04 — Write tests for F24 behavior
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/test_runner.py`: (1) `missing_tasks_summary` does not flag a feature whose task file is in `tasks/done/`; (2) `scaffold/.j2/tasks/done/` directory exists in the scaffold; (3) `install.sh` creates `tasks/done/` in the target directory.
