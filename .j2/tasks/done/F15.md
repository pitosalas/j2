# F15 — Principles File

## Tasks

### T01 — Verify scaffold ships a default rules.md
**Status**: done
**Description**: Confirm `scaffold/.j2/rules.md` exists and contains reasonable default principles (testing, Python version, style). Review its contents match the project's own rules.md as a good example.

### T02 — Verify runner injects rules into every template
**Status**: done (checkpoint.md and try.md intentionally excluded — they save state, not generate code)
**Description**: Check that every template under `scaffold/.j2/templates/` contains a `{{rules}}` placeholder so the principles file is always injected. Add `{{rules}}` to any template that is missing it.

### T03 — Write tests for rules.md scaffold and template injection
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests that assert `scaffold/.j2/rules.md` exists and is non-empty, and that every template file contains the `{{rules}}` placeholder.

### T04 — Add test for case-insensitive feature/task ID lookup
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests to cover the fix made to `extract_feature` and `extract_task` so they accept lowercase IDs (e.g. `f15`, `t01`). This was a usability bug found while generating F15 tasks.
