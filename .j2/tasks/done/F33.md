# F33 — `/features-parallel` Command

## Tasks

### T01 — Create `features_parallel.md` template
**Status**: done
**Description**: Create `.j2/templates/features_parallel.md`. The template receives `{{features}}` and `{{rules}}`. Instructions: scan the features for all entries that are not `done` and have a task file in `.j2/tasks/`. For each, launch a background Task agent (using Claude Code's Task tool with `run_in_background: true`) with instructions to implement all not-started tasks in that feature sequentially — same behavior as `/task-run-all`. The agent should read `.j2/rules.md` for coding principles. Agents must not modify `features.md`, `state.md`, or `README.md`. After launching all agents, report which features were started and remind the user to run `/milestone <FID>` for each when done.

### T02 — Register command in workflow.yaml and create slash command
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a `features-parallel` entry to `.j2/config/workflow.yaml` pointing to `features_parallel.md`. Create `.claude/commands/features-parallel.md` with frontmatter description and `$(python3 .j2/runner.py features-parallel --root .)`. This command takes no arguments.

### T03 — Write tests for features-parallel
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests verifying: (1) `features_parallel.md` template exists and contains `{{features}}` and `{{rules}}` but not `{{spec}}`, (2) the workflow.yaml entry exists and points to the correct template, (3) the slash command file exists and calls runner.py with the right command.
