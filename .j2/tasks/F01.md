# F01 — Directory Structure Scaffold

## Tasks

### T01 — Remove stale hooks/ directory from scaffold
**Status**: done
**Description**: `scaffold/.j2/hooks/` exists but is no longer part of the design (commands live in `.claude/commands/`). Delete the directory. Confirm no files are in it first.

### T02 — Add .gitkeep files to empty scaffold directories
**Status**: done (n/a — dirs already contain stub files; .gitkeep not needed)
**Description**: `scaffold/.j2/specs/`, `scaffold/.j2/features/`, and `scaffold/.j2/tasks/` need `.gitkeep` files so git tracks them when empty. Without these, the directories won't be included when the scaffold is copied into a new project.

### T03 — Write test that verifies scaffold directory structure
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a test in `tests/` that asserts all required directories and stub files exist under `scaffold/`. Required dirs: `scaffold/.j2/{specs,features,tasks,config,templates}`, `scaffold/.claude/commands/`. Test should fail if any are missing.
