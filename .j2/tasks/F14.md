# Tasks for F14 — ROS2 Configuration Profile

### T01 — Create ROS2 settings profile YAML
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add `scaffold/.j2/config/settings.ros2.yaml` with ROS2-specific overrides: `platform: ros2`, and any ROS2-specific keys (e.g. `ros2.package_type`, `ros2.node_type`). This file is not loaded by default — users copy it over `settings.yaml` when starting a ROS2 project.

### T02 — Create ROS2 feature-generation template
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add `scaffold/.j2/templates/gen_features.ros2.md` that extends the base feature-generation prompt with ROS2-specific guidance: suggest features for nodes, topics, services, launch files, and package structure. Users swap this in by updating `workflow.yaml` to point `features-gen` at the ROS2 template.

### T03 — Create ROS2 task-generation template
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add `scaffold/.j2/templates/gen_tasks.ros2.md` that extends the base task-generation prompt with ROS2 conventions: CMakeLists, package.xml, colcon build, rclpy/rclcpp patterns. Same swap-in mechanism as T02.

### T04 — Write tests for the ROS2 profile
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/` verifying: (1) `settings.ros2.yaml` is valid YAML and contains the expected keys, (2) runner can load the ROS2 templates without errors when the workflow is pointed at them.
