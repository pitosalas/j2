# F02 — YAML Configuration System

## Tasks

### T01 — Verify settings.yaml has all keys required by runner.py
**Status**: done
**Description**: Cross-check every `settings["j2"][...]` and `settings["project"][...]` access in `runner.py` against the scaffold's `settings.yaml`. Add any missing keys. Remove any keys the runner never reads.

### T02 — Verify workflow.yaml covers all slash commands and templates exist
**Status**: done
**Description**: Check that `workflow.yaml` has a step entry for every slash command (spec-review, gen-features, refine-features, gen-tasks, refine-tasks, start-task, next-task, try, checkpoint, milestone). Confirm each referenced template file exists under `scaffold/.j2/templates/`.

### T03 — Write tests that validate scaffold config files
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests that load the real scaffold `settings.yaml` and `workflow.yaml` and assert required keys are present and all template files referenced by workflow steps actually exist on disk.
