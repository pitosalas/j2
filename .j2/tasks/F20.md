# Tasks for F20 — Prompt-with-Default Input Pattern

### T01 — Update `refine_features.md` to prompt for request
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Remove reliance on `{{request}}` being pre-filled from `$ARGUMENTS`. Add an instruction at the top of the template telling Claude to ask the user what they'd like to change, and to suggest a concrete default based on the current feature list (e.g. the next not-started feature that looks ready to refine). The `{{features}}` placeholder already provides enough context to generate a good default.

### T02 — Update `gen_tasks.md` to prompt for feature ID
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Replace the `{{feature}}` placeholder (single extracted section) with `{{features}}` (full list). Add an instruction telling Claude to ask the user which feature to generate tasks for, defaulting to the first feature with status `not started` and no existing task file. Claude then works from the full features list rather than a pre-extracted section.

### T03 — Update `refine_tasks.md` to prompt for feature ID and request
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Replace `{{tasks}}` (pre-loaded for a specific feature) with `{{features}}` so Claude has the full list. Add instructions to ask the user which feature's tasks to refine (defaulting to the first in-progress feature) and what change to make (with a suggested default). Claude reads the relevant task file directly once it knows the feature.

### T04 — Update `start_task.md` to prompt for feature ID
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Replace `{{feature}}` and `{{tasks}}` with `{{features}}` so Claude has the full list. Add an instruction to ask the user which feature to work on, defaulting to the first in-progress or not-started feature that has a task file. Claude then reads the task file directly and picks the first not-started task.

### T05 — Update `deploy.md` to prompt for target directory
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Remove reliance on `{{request}}` for the directory path. Add an instruction telling Claude to ask the user for the target directory, suggesting a sensible default (e.g. `~/projects/myproject`). Claude then runs `mkdir -p` and `install.sh` with the confirmed path.

### T06 — Update command files to remove argument wiring
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Update the scaffold and dev-repo command files for `features-refine`, `tasks-gen`, `tasks-refine`, `task-start`, and `deploy` to drop `--feature`, `--task`, and `--request` arguments. Each command file should invoke `runner.py <command> --root .` with no extra args. Update tests in `test_commands.py` accordingly.

### T07 — Write tests for prompt-with-default pattern
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add tests to `tests/test_runner.py` verifying that each updated template contains the prompt-with-default instruction text (e.g. checks for "ask" or "default" or "suggest" in the rendered output). Also verify the affected templates no longer require `--feature` or `--request` to render without errors.
