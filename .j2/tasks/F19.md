# Tasks for F19 — `/deploy` Command

### T01 — Handle missing directory argument in deploy template
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Update `scaffold/.j2/templates/deploy.md` so that when `{{request}}` is empty or `None`, the prompt instructs Claude to ask the user for a target directory before proceeding (suggesting `../my-new-project` as a default). Currently the template assumes `{{request}}` is always provided.

### T02 — Harden the deploy bash commands
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Review the bash block in `scaffold/.j2/templates/deploy.md`. Confirm the `mkdir -p`, `bash scaffold/install.sh`, and `cp .j2/runner.py` sequence is correct and note any edge cases (e.g. target dir is an absolute path outside the repo, install.sh fails). Update the template with any fixes and a clearer success/failure reporting instruction.

### T03 — Write tests for the deploy command
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/` covering: (1) runner renders the deploy template with a provided `--request` value, (2) runner renders the deploy template with an empty `--request` and the output contains a prompt for the user. At least one test must pass per the coding principles.
