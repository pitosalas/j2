# F06 — `/refine-features` Command

## Tasks

### T01 — Add status header preservation guidance to refine_features template
**Status**: done
**Description**: The refine_features template currently tells Claude to output the complete updated feature list, but doesn't remind it to preserve the status values legend at the top. Add a line instructing Claude to keep the header intact in the output.

### T02 — Write end-to-end rendering test for refine-features
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a test that renders the refine-features template with a sample features list and a refinement request, verifying that `{{features}}`, `{{rules}}`, and `{{request}}` are all injected and no unresolved placeholders remain in the output.
