# Tasks for F16 — `/checkpoint` Command

### T01 — Instruct Claude to write output to `.j2/current.md`
**Status**: not started
**Description**: `scaffold/.j2/templates/checkpoint.md` says "Output the content of `current.md` only" but never tells Claude to write it to disk. Add an explicit instruction at the end of the template: "Write this content to `.j2/current.md`, overwriting any existing file." This is the only action needed for the checkpoint to actually persist state.

### T02 — Include `state.md` context in checkpoint template
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add `{{state}}` (or inline the contents of `.j2/state.md`) to the checkpoint template so Claude knows what was most recently completed and what the recommended next step is. This avoids duplication between `current.md` and `state.md` and makes the checkpoint more accurate. Requires adding a `state` loader to `build_context` in `runner.py`.

### T03 — Write tests for the checkpoint command
**Status**: not started
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/` verifying: (1) runner renders the checkpoint template and injects `{{features}}`, (2) the rendered output contains the expected sections (completed, in progress, next, open questions). At least one test must pass per the coding principles.
