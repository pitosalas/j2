# F22 — Colored Structured Footer Tasks

### T01 — Implement FOOTER constant in runner.py
**Status**: done
**Description**: FOOTER is appended to every rendered prompt. Contains three ANSI-colored lines: `completed:`, `state:` (with `<N>` integer count placeholders), and `next:`. Also instructs Claude to write the same three lines to `.j2/state.md` without ANSI codes.

### T02 — Write tests for FOOTER structure
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests that verify: (1) FOOTER contains ANSI escape codes for all three color labels, (2) FOOTER contains the state.md writing instruction, (3) rendered output from any command includes the footer. The existing `test_rendered_output_contains_state_and_next_footer` covers (3); add specific tests for (1) and (2).
