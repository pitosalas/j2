# F09 — `/start-task` Command

## Tasks

### T01 — Add post-implementation instructions to start_task template
**Status**: done
**Description**: The template tells Claude to implement the task and explain decisions, but doesn't instruct it to update the task's `**Status**` to `done` in the task file afterward. Add a closing instruction telling Claude what to do after implementing (update status, run tests, report what's next).

### T02 — Write end-to-end rendering test for start-task
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add a test that renders the start-task template with a sample spec, rules, feature, and task. Assert all four placeholders are injected and no unresolved placeholders remain.
