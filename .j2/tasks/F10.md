# Tasks for F10 — `/milestone` Command

### T01 — Parameterize milestone command with a feature ID
**Status**: done
**Description**: The current `milestone` slash command takes no arguments and reviews all features at once. Update `.claude/commands/milestone.md` to pass `--feature $ARGUMENTS` to runner.py. Update `scaffold/.j2/templates/milestone.md` to use `{{feature}}` (single feature section) instead of `{{features}}` (all features), so the milestone review is scoped to one feature.

### T02 — Include task list in milestone template
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add `{{tasks}}` to `scaffold/.j2/templates/milestone.md` so Claude can verify every task in the feature is marked `done` before granting the milestone. Add an explicit instruction: if any task is `not started` or `in progress`, list them and refuse to declare the milestone.

### T03 — Add status-update output instruction to milestone template
**Status**: done
**Description**: The template currently says "restate the feature's status line" but doesn't give Claude a clear output format. Add an instruction to output the complete updated feature entry (status set to `done`, tests written `yes`, tests passing `yes`) in a fenced code block so the developer can paste it directly into `features.md`.

### T04 — Write tests for the milestone command
**Status**: done
**Description**: Add tests in `tests/` verifying: (1) runner renders the milestone template with a valid feature ID and includes the feature section and task list in output, (2) runner exits with an error when the feature ID is missing. At least one test must pass per the coding principles.
