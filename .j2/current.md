## In Progress
Nothing — all 33 features complete.

## Just Completed
- F30: Token minimization — removed spec/features from task templates, added filter_done_features()
- F31: Parallel-safe command documentation — added Parallel Usage section to README
- F32: `/task-run-all` command — run all tasks in a feature without stopping
- F33: `/features-parallel` command — launch background agents for multiple features
- Updated rules.md — removed redundant rules, added testing/output/error-handling rules
- Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for session orientation
- Fixed merge conflict in README badges

## Next Steps
- Use `/features-update` to add new features, or `/deploy` to ship
- Test `/task-run-all` and `/features-parallel` on a real multi-feature project

## Open Questions
None.
