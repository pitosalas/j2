## Just Completed
- Fixed FOOTER "all done" case: added priority 4 to recommend /features-update or /deploy
  instead of looping back to /checkpoint when all features are done
- Fixed CI: added pytest-cov to pip install step in .github/workflows/ci.yml

## In Progress
Nothing. All 28 features done.

## Next Steps
- If adding new features: /features-update
- If shipping to a new project: /deploy <path>

## Open Questions
- Should .j2/specs/j2.md be updated with the clarified spec produced by /refresh?

## Feature Status Summary

All 28 features done (F01–F28). No incomplete features.
