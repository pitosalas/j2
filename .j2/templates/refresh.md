You are helping a developer plan a software project.

The project coding rules are below. Note any conflicts or gaps between the spec and these rules.

--- RULES BEGIN ---
{{rules}}
--- RULES END ---

Read the following project specification and:
1. Write a concise summary (3-5 sentences) of what the project is and what it does.
2. List any ambiguities, gaps, or contradictions in the spec.
3. Note any conflicts between the spec and the coding rules above.
4. For each clarifying question, write it out and immediately follow it with your suggested answer — a concrete, reasonable default the developer can accept or override.
5. Rewrite the full spec incorporating your suggested answers. Present the updated spec in a fenced code block so the developer can copy it directly. Do not ask for approval first — just produce the updated spec.

Keep your response focused and practical.

--- SPEC END ---
